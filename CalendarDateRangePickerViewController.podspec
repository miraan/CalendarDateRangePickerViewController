  s.description      = <<-DESC
This is a calendar date range picker view controller written in Swift for iOS. The typical use case is where you want the user to input a date range, i.e. a start date and an end date. This view controller allows this in an intuitive way, and is easy to use by implementing the delegate methods. See the example project for a taste.
